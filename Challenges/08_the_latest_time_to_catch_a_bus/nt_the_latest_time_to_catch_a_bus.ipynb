    "\n",
    "**Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a 0-indexed integer array 'buses' of length n, where buses[i] represents the departure time of the ith bus. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array 'passengers' of length m, where passengers[j] represents the arrival time of the jth passenger. All bus departure times are unique. All passenger arrival times are unique. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an integer 'capacity', which represents the maximum number of passengers that can get on each bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a passenger arrives, they will wait in line for the next available bus. You can get on a bus that departs at x minutes if you arrive at y minutes where y <= x, and the bus is not full. Passengers with the earliest arrival times get on the bus first.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally when a bus arrives, either:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If 'capacity' or fewer passengers are waiting for a bus, they will all get on the bus, or\n",
    "- The 'capacity' passengers with the earliest arrival times will get on the bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the latest time you may arrive at the bus station to catch a bus. You cannot arrive at the same time as another passenger.\n",

    "At time 20, the second bus departs with you and the 1st passenger.\\\n",
    "Note that you may not arrive at the same time as another passenger, which is why you must arrive before the 1st passenger to catch the bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example 2*\\\n",
    "Input: buses = [20,30,10], passengers = [19,13,26,4,25,11,21], capacity = 2\\\n",

    "At time 20, the second bus departs with the 5th and 1st passengers.\\\n",
    "At time 30, the third bus departs with the 0th passenger and you.\\\n",
    "Notice if you had arrived any later, then the 6th passenger would have taken your seat on the third bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "n == buses.length\\\n",
    "m == passengers.length\\\n",

    "The proposed solution find explicitly which passengers took each specific bus. Then, it calculates at what time you can arrive to take a bus, a.k.a *the latest time to catch a bus*. By its part, the external solution approaches to the problem using the [two-pointer](https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/library/what-is-a-two-pointer-technique) technique. Although it is more efficient and runs faster, it does not take into account the constraints of the problems. As consequence, the results from the set of inputs 3 and 4 are not the right ones when executing the external solution."
