# Data Portfolio 

### Motivation and structure

<p align="justify">
Along our lives we participate in several projects, either due to study or work purposes. Most of the times we do not have a record of what we do, giving as consequence the inevitable loss of our efforts. This repository is my personal way to save such endeavors and share them with the community. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
The Data Portfolio is composed into two main parts, namely, <b>Challenges</b> and <b>Projects</b>. 
</p>

### ðŸ”° [Challenges](https://github.com/wgfajardom/portfolio/tree/main/Challenges)

<p align="justify">
Challenges are a set of code exercises that are typically found on technical interviews for data-related roles. Every challenge has one folder and at least four files following this nomenclature:
</p>

*Folder*: folder having all the information of the challenge with its numerical identifier ("XX") and its name (<challenge_name>).\
*Path*: portfolio/Challenges/XX_<challenge_name>

*Task*: description of the challenge.\
*Path*: portfolio/Challenges/XX_<challenge_name>/task_<challenge_name>.text

*Proposed Solution*: personal solution of the challenge written in Python.\
*Path*: portfolio/Challenges/XX_<challenge_name>/code_<challenge_name>.py

*External Solution*: solution achieved by other person also written in Python, giving an additional or external point of view.\
*Path*: portfolio/Challenges/XX_<challenge_name>/ext_<challenge_name>.py

*Notebook*: Jupyter Notebook gathering the task description, proposed and external solutions, into a single human-readable document.\
*Path*: portfolio/Challenges/XX_<challenge_name>/nt_<challenge_name>.ipynb

### ðŸ“š [Projects](https://github.com/wgfajardom/portfolio/tree/main/Projects)

This folder is empty so far. Projects will be added in future releases.
